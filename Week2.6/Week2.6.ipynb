In the process, we introduce the concept of asynchronicity, generators, parallelism and message queues. The central idea is that we have some data that needs to be harvested, transformed and distributed. We build this applica\u0000on in several more or less independent steps, in order to bring the idea home that separa\u0000on and compartmentaliza\u0000on are good things.'\n",
